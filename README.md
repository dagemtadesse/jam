# Jam
Jam is an online comment and complaint platform that allows its users to share their experience as well
as leave feedback about any company on a specified channel.

Channels can also be narrowed down to sub channels to allow specific targeted content sharing
for and among users. Each channel and sub channel covers a different and unique topic.

Another feature of the user is the role of the user. A client can either be a regular user or an admin.
An admin is a volunteer client who maintains the channel they are in charge of.
An admin can create and update channels on the platform.

A regular user on the other hand can post and experience or complaint and comment on posts.

A user can add and remove channels to and from bookmarks.

When signing up a user must fill out a form that mandates the users's full name, email, address and role (regular or admin).
finally users can also go to profiles to change passwords and their profile information.

A post in JAM is a content that can be shared by the user to provide information. In JAM version 1.0 (i.e current version) the supported media for posts is text. 
A post also has an upvote and downvote feature that will determine its popularity and visibility among users in JAM.
A post also allows other user's to leave comments on it. This is done to encourage engagement among users.
