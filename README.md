# Jam
Jam is a news aggregator online platform that allows its users to share content, comments, news as well
as leave feedback on different channels that are hosted on the site.

Channels can also be narrowed down to subchannels to allow specific taregted content sharing
for and among users. Each channel and sub channel covers a different and unique topic.

Channels are verified to provide a guarentee for user's that the channels they are aquiring 
news and content from is a legitimate JAM component.

A user can access JAM either as a browsing client(with out signing up for JAM) or can 
sign up to become a verified user. A verified user is able to share content, upvote or downvote 
posts and also leave comments while a browsing user can not.

Another feature of the user is the role of the user. A client can either be a regular user or a channel manager.
A channel manager is a volenteer clinet who maintains the channel they are in charge of.

When signing up a user must fill out a form that madates the users's full name, email, adress, occupation (student or employee) and role.

A post in JAM is a content that can be shared by the user to provide information. In JAM version 1.0 (i.e current version) the supported media 
for posts is text and image. 
A post also has an upvote and downvote feature that will determine its popularity and visibility among users in JAM.
A post also allows other user's to leave comments on it. This is done to encourage engagment among users.
